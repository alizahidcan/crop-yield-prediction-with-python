## Project Overview

In this project, crop yield is predicted using machine learning algorithms based on environmental factors (such as temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture) and agricultural practices (such as fertilizer use, irrigation, and seed type). The model aims to predict crop yield to help farmers improve their crop production and make more accurate farming decisions.

## Getting Started

The project follows these main steps to make crop yield predictions:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset should contain environmental and agricultural factors.I will use https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset/data in this project.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and convert categorical variables to numeric values.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the best machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) based on the data.
4. **Model Training and Testing**: Split the data into training and testing sets, and evaluate model performance.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the modelâ€™s predictions and evaluation metrics.
